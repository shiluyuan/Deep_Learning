I use face picture for classification.<br />
There are seven lables. <br />
A anger<br />
B contempt<br />
C fear<br />
D happiness<br />
E neutral<br />
F sadness<br />
G surprise<br />

However, I face two problems, one is overfitting. The trainning accuracy is 90% and test accuarcy is only 57%. <br />
The second problem is when I reload the trained model, each time I run prediction, the result seems different. <br />
Maybe someone can see my code and tell me what can I do to fix the problems.

For the trainning speed. I use gtx 1080 and batch size is 32. I can train 9700 pictures in 765.
